dark mode first

in the beginning, there was dark mode. kind to the eyes and brilliant in its simplicity.

over the generations our uis have become shiny and full of CRAP. our webpages are bright and painful to look at. and not until recently has macos even had a dark mode.

linux has had dark themes forever. and a huge portion of software products that require all day staring at have dark or at least darker modes. many of us who have to stare at a screen for 20 hours a day have plugins for chrome to make everything dark. and even before chrome and browsers we had xp high contrast mode. there have been dark mode options forever. but why has it never been main stream? why are the people who CREATE your browser, your websites, your operations systems all using dark modes. but not EVERYONE ELSE?

its time to stop staring into the light and get back to the dark ages.

dark. mode. first.
